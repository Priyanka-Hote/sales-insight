# SALES-INSIGHTS

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware is a company in India that supplies computer hardware and peripheral devices across India only.
They have many stores across India, such as surge stores, Nomad stores, etc. The head office of the company is situated in Delhi.

Scenario —

The sales manager of the company is facing many challenges. He is facing issues tracking sales in a dynamically growing market. He is having issues with the insights from his business.

In order to do this, he has some of the regional managers in North, South, and Central India working for the company. So he calls them and asks about the insights he wants to know.
They tell him about the sales in last quarter and the growth in that quarter.So, the problem is that the conversations that are happening are verbal. Hence, the regional managers
are sugar coating the facts, and the manager of the company does not get a clear picture of the facts. Even after knowing that sales are declining, he cannot do anything because 
He does not have a clear picture of the sales. When he asks for the records, the regional manager provides him with Excel files. But because of this, he cannot figure out small things.
All the manager wants is a view of the weakest areas on which the company needs to focus to increase sales and improve the decline. He is interested in simple, understandable
and digestive insight. So, he is more interested in a dashboard where he can go and look at the real data because data speaks the truth. 
All he wants is a simple data visualization tool that he can access on a daily basis.

Hence, by using such tools and technology, one can make data-driven decisions, which helps to increase the sales of the company.

So, in this project, we will help a company make its own sales-related dashboard using PowerBI.

In our case the end result will be the dashboard created and success criteria will be bumping up the sales using cost optimization and
save the time of the manager of the company.
